# WordPeek
Ever been deep into a PDF or document, stumbled upon a word you didn’t know, and then lost focus jumping between tabs to Google its meaning?
That exact moment inspired me to build **WordPeek** — a lightweight desktop companion that lets you instantly look up any word or phrase without ever leaving your document.
